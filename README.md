DAY 1 — PYTHON LEARNING NOTES (Your Progress Today)

A complete summary of concepts you learned while building your CLI
calculator

1.  While Loops & Program Flow

-   while True keeps the program running.
-   continue skips to next loop.
-   break exits the loop.
-   Fixed mistake: if cont == “y” or “Y” -> always true. Correct:
    cont.lower() == “y”.

2.  Functions

-   def creates a function.
-   return outputs a value.
-   You created add, subtract, multiply, divide.

3.  Getting Safe User Input

-   Learned try/except.
-   Prevents program from crashing.
-   Used float(input()) safely.

4.  Input Validation (Menu Choices)

-   Validates choices 1–4.
-   Handles ValueError.
-   Professional-grade input validation.

5.  Division by Zero Handling

-   If y == 0: block added.
-   Prevents crash.
-   Example of defensive programming.

6.  Tracking State with Lists (History Feature)

-   history = []
-   history.append()
-   f-strings for clean formatting.
-   Operators chosen with [‘+’,‘-’,’*‘,’/’][choice-1].

7.  Organizing Code Flow Correctly

-   Fixed unreachable code.
-   Learned execution order.
-   Understood indentation’s effect.

8.  Debugging Skills Improved

-   Read errors.
-   Traced logic bugs.
-   Verified output by testing.
-   Fixed indentation & flow issues.

SUMMARY: What You Can Do Now - Write functions - Use loops effectively -
Validate input - Prevent crashes - Handle exceptions - Build CLI apps -
Track history - Debug - Organize code

Excellent progress for a single day.
